Phil: Can we do something if we can do an incremental number?
	- Query Unique tuples, and check how many of the tuples exist
	- Take number, and add 1 to the number of records. 

How we will create the primary key:
	- Generate the letter portion of the primary key
	- Generate random number
	- Put primary key together
	- Query database to see if the primary key exists
	- If primary key exists:
		- Add +1 to the numeric part of the primary key
		- Check again
	
	- Assign primary to to Question object
